# Multi-level Inheritance: The members of the parent class, A, are inherited by child class which is then inherited by another child class, B. 
# The features of the base class and the derived class are further inherited into the new derived class, C. Here, A is the grandfather class of class C
# Parent class
class A:
   def __init__(self, a_name):
       self.a_name = a_name
   
# Intermediate class
class B(A):
   def __init__(self, b_name, a_name):
       self.b_name = b_name
       # invoke constructor of class A
       A.__init__(self, a_name)

# Child class
class C(B):
   def __init__(self,c_name, b_name, a_name):
       self.c_name = c_name
       # invoke constructor of class B
       B.__init__(self, b_name, a_name)
       
   def display_names(self):
       print("A name : ", self.a_name)
       print("B name : ", self.b_name)
       print("C name : ", self.c_name)
