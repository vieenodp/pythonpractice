# Generator-Function : A generator-function is defined like a normal function, 
# but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than return. 
# If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function.
# A generator function that yields 1 for first time,
# 2 second time and 3 third time
